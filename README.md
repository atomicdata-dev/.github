*The easiest way to **create**, **share** and **model** linked data.*

Atomic Data is a proposed standard for modeling and exchanging linked data. It uses links to connect pieces of data, and therefore makes it easier to connect datasets to each other, even when these datasets exist on separate machines. It aims to help realize a more decentralized internet that encourages data ownership and interoperability.

Atomic Data is especially suitable for knowledge graphs, distributed datasets, semantic data, p2p applications, decentralized apps, and data that is meant to be shared. It is designed to be highly extensible, easy to use, and to make the process of domain specific standardization as simple as possible.

Run your own server
-------------------

The easiest way to run an [atomic-server](https://github.com/atomicdata-dev/atomic-data-rust) is to run `cargo install atomic-server`, but there's also Docker images and native binaries.
